# GTEA Gaze Cleaned Annotations

This repo contains cleaned annotations for the
[GTEA Gaze+](http://ai.stanford.edu/~alireza/GTEA_Gaze_Website/GTEA_Gaze+.html)
database. Particularly, the details are exactly the same, but the files are
cleaned up where they deviate from an accepted format.

Particularly, they take one of the following forms:

````
    <verb>\t+<time>\t+<time>\t+<verb>(<noun>)
    <verb>\t+<time>\t+<time>\t+<verb>(<noun>, <noun>, ...)
````

Note that a single space may follow any commas. This may be fixed later.
